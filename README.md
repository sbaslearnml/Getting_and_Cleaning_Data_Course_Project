## Purpose
This is the project assignement for the Coursera topic "Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project"

https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-cleaning/peer/FIZtT/getting-and-cleaning-data-course-project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected

## Dependencies 
Prepare_Tidy_Data_Set.R script requires reshape2 and data.table packages

## Steps to create the tidy data set
1. Download Prepare_Tidy_Data_Set.R to the home directory
2. Install reshape2 and data.table packages, if they are not installed already
3. Run the below scripts
    ``` source('~/Prepare_Tidy_Data_Set.R') ```
